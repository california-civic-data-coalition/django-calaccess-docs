Contribute to django-calaccess-raw-data
=======================================

This walkthrough is for developers who want to contribute to :doc:`/apps/calaccess_raw`, a Django app to download, extract and load campaign-finance and lobbying-activity data from the California Secretary of Stateâ€™s CAL-ACCESS database.

It will show you how to install the source code of this application to fix bugs and develop new features.

---------------


Preparing a development environment
-----------------------------------

It is not required, but it is recommended that development of the library be done from within a contained virtual environment.

One way to accomplish that is with Python's ``virtualenv`` tool and its helpful companion ``virtualenvwrapper``. If you have that installed, a new project can be started with the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mkproject django-calaccess-raw-data

That will jump into a new folder in your code directory, where you can clone our
code repository from GitHub_ after you make a fork of your own. Don't know what that means? `Read this`_.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/<YOUR-USERNAME>/django-calaccess-raw-data.git .

Next install the other Python libraries our code depends on.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

---------------


Connecting to a local database
------------------------------

Unlike a typical Django project, this application only supports the
PostgreSQL database backend. This is because we enlist specialized tools to load
the immense amount of source data more quickly than Django typically allows.

Creating your database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create the database the PostgreSQL way.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ createdb calaccess_raw -U postgres

Create a file at ``example/project/settings_local.py`` to save your custom database credentials. That might look something like this.

.. code-block:: python

    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'NAME': 'calaccess_raw',
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
            'USER': 'username', # <-- Change this
            'PASSWORD': 'password', # <-- And this
            'HOST': 'localhost',
            'PORT': '5432'
        }
    }

.. note::

    If you'd prefer to load the CAL-ACCESS outside your default database, check out our guide to working with Django's system for `multiple databases`_.

---------------


Once the database is configured
-------------------------------

Now create the tables and get to work.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python example/manage.py migrate

Once everything is set up, the updatecalaccessrawdata_ command will download the latest bulk data release from `the Secretary of State's website`_ load it into your local database.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python example/manage.py updatecalaccessrawdata

.. warning::

    This will take a while. Go grab some coffee.

Welcome aboard!

Now that your development environment is set up, check out the `GitHub issue tracker`_ where plenty of work awaits.

As you submit your work, please pay attention to the results of our `integration tests`_ (more details :doc:`here </contribute/testing>`).
